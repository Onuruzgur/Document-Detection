There are two .ipynb code files in this folder. 
The main.ipynb code file receives and processes and prints training and test images,
but does not show results or results from intermediate processes.
For this, a separate code file was written for error detection and improvement during the project construction phase and
the intermediate results were analyzed.
 You can also run the train.ipynb code file to evaluate, understand the code, and see the stages.
The code is explained in the main.ipynb code file.

Since the path in the file opening process in the Main.ipynb code file will be different because you will run it on your own computer, 
it will give an error.

Since the original image was too large in the test.ipynb code file, a temporary image was created and the image was reduced in size and printed.
